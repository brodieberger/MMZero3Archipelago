# Mega Man Zero 3 Archipelago

Welcome to my project. Things are still under heavy development, but here you will find my development of a custom Archipelago World for Mega Man Zero 3 on the GBA.

Most of the work done so far has just been setting up dummy files that would be replaced later. Work on Rom patching or an actual randomizer has not been started.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on discord: Stingrays110
